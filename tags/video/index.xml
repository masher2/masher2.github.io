      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve noted that lately I have developed a view of how life should be lived that can be summarized in 3 points:
 Don&amp;rsquo;t try to optimize your life for anything. Don&amp;rsquo;t mindlessly accept your life as it comes. Don&amp;rsquo;t limit your interests to only one thing.  Most of the comment I have on things I see through the week fit inside those 3 points as I think everybody could benefit from that perspective.</description>

      <description>[video] The Death of Melody An exploration of what is melody and how it has gone out of fashion, resulting in most modern music lacking melody used as an &amp;ldquo;expressive tool&amp;rdquo;. The video also exposes some events that could have driven the death of melody over the years such as the discover of &amp;ldquo;the hook&amp;rdquo; in popular songs and the rise of electronic music.
This made me think about the kind of music that I like and what auditory experiences I could be missing due to the kind of music I&amp;rsquo;m exposed to.</description>

      <description>This week I found an amazing zine about open hardware and decentralized software projects. It is offered as a print edition or as a free download here, you should check it out, it&amp;rsquo;s a nice throwback to the experience of reading a magazine, even if it is through a monitor.
[video] Shoshana Zuboff on surveillance capitalism | VPRO Documentary This is one of the most relevant videos that I have seen on the topic of why big tech companies are absolutely awful, everyone needs to see this as Shoshana explains it very well.</description>

      <description>This is the first post that I write using my new Drop ALT keyboard, I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect to be this hooked to the typing experience of a mechanical keyboard but how much nicer it feels to type on this can&amp;rsquo;t be ignored, I even placed it on top of my laptop to use it instead of it&amp;rsquo;s own keyboard (inspired by this video).
Another thing that excites me about this keyboard is that it can be customized though QMK, I can see this becoming a new hobby of mine.</description>

      <description>This month I revisited my favourite anime: GaoGaiGar. No matter how I try to describe how much I like this anime I don&amp;rsquo;t think I can make it justice. On a first glance it is your standard monster of the week mecha anime with a bland plot and over the top fights, but as the show progresses the personalities of the characters begin to shine, they are some of the most likable characters in any anime I have seen.</description>

      <description>[blog-post] Navigating the internet as a non-binary designer This one caught me by surprise, the problems of gender nonconforming people are something that never crosses my mind as I don&amp;rsquo;t know nor interact with any in my daily life. I came across this post on twitter the other day and thought it would be nice to read as I really don&amp;rsquo;t know much about it and it is always nice to see how people can have completely diferent experiences from yours.</description>

      <description>[blog-post] Our history is a battle against the microbes: we lost terribly before science, public health, and vaccines allowed us to protect ourselves A data-backed post showing how much infectious diseases affected us during our history and how vaccines helped us in our struggle for survival.
This post comes in a time most opportune, as more and more people are concerned with the effects and motivations behind vaccination, serving as a reminder that without vaccines the world would be an even dangerous place than it is right now.</description>
