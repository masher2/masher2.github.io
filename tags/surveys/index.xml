      <description>[blog-post] Navigating the internet as a non-binary designer This one caught me by surprise, the problems of gender nonconforming people are something that never crosses my mind as I don&amp;rsquo;t know nor interact with any in my daily life. I came across this post on twitter the other day and thought it would be nice to read as I really don&amp;rsquo;t know much about it and it is always nice to see how people can have completely diferent experiences from yours.</description>
