      <description>This week I found an amazing zine about open hardware and decentralized software projects. It is offered as a print edition or as a free download here, you should check it out, it&amp;rsquo;s a nice throwback to the experience of reading a magazine, even if it is through a monitor.
[video] Shoshana Zuboff on surveillance capitalism | VPRO Documentary This is one of the most relevant videos that I have seen on the topic of why big tech companies are absolutely awful, everyone needs to see this as Shoshana explains it very well.</description>

      <description>This week I freed (i.e. open sourced) a bot that claimed the reward from frebitco.in automatically, it served me for over a year but as I withdrew everything from the page I no longer care if anybody uses it.

It is hands down one of the best shows I&amp;rsquo;ve seen.
Dan Barber, the chef featured in the second episode, was the one that most resonated with me; the restaurants he owns revolve around the concept of farm to table, cooking the ingredients as close as posible to the source, all local and sustainable.</description>
