      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve spent most of my free time painting, and probably will keep it like that until #linktober ends, so all my posts through this month will most likely be very short.
Here are my entries this last week.
 Day 11: Ganon/Ganondorf. Ganondorf playing the pipe organ. Ocarina of Time. Day 12: Mask. Zant&amp;rsquo;s Helmet. Twilight Princess. Day 13: Sheikah. Impa. Skyward Sword. Day 14: Food. A bowl of Yeto&amp;rsquo;s superb soup.</description>
