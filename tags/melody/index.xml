      <description>[video] The Death of Melody An exploration of what is melody and how it has gone out of fashion, resulting in most modern music lacking melody used as an &amp;ldquo;expressive tool&amp;rdquo;. The video also exposes some events that could have driven the death of melody over the years such as the discover of &amp;ldquo;the hook&amp;rdquo; in popular songs and the rise of electronic music.
This made me think about the kind of music that I like and what auditory experiences I could be missing due to the kind of music I&amp;rsquo;m exposed to.</description>
