      <description>This week I played Hellblade: Senua’s sacrifice, I was interested in this game because it’s an adventure seen through a schizophrenic woman’s eyes, there are visual artifacts through the game and voices, friendly and hostile, that whisper, speak and scream to you from all directions, as if they come from inside your mind, all to make you feel immersed in the experience of living as a schizophrenic. It was a short game but deeply engaging, it truly is a story that is best told through an interactive medium like videogames.</description>

      <description>Not much happened this week, I started developing a vim plugin to manage my blog, read a little and continued with Chef’s Table; the 1st episode of the 3rd season had me in tears through the whole episode, it was beautiful seeing Jeong Kwan cooking and sharing her story, my favourite chapter yet.
 [video] Joe Rogan is wondering what I’m hiding!: Rob Braxman responding to a comment made by Joe Rogan in the june second episode of Joe Rogan Experience in which while talking about mass surveillance Joe express that he has been following Rob Braxman and wonders why is he so concerned about online privacy, “what is he hiding?</description>

      <description>Recently I’ve been watching Chef’s Table, as the name sugests it is about chefs, with each episode being a short documentary about a single chef’s history, the restaurants in which they are working and why they are cooking as they are. It is hands down one of the best shows I’ve seen.
Dan Barber, the chef featured in the second episode, was the one that most resonated with me; the restaurants he owns revolve around the concept of farm to table, cooking the ingredients as close as posible to the source, all local and sustainable.</description>

      <description>I’m currently into the local sustainable section of The omnivore’s dilemma, reading about Polyface farm feels like a dream, it’s incredible how that way of farming contrasts with the industrial way of highly scaled monocrop fields.
One of the things that came to my mind whilst reading this section was that automation isn’t always synonym with progress, even though the industrial food system has skyrocketed the production of food, it has done so despite the damage it causes to the land and the ecosystem.</description>

      <description>This week I finished the second part of The omnivore’s dilemma, the one about the industrial organic food system. Not much changes compared to the plain industrial food system, the main difference stands in the lack of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, but the conditions of everything else, from how fields are distributed and harvested to how animals are kept stays the same, factory farms.
The funny thing about this is the history behind some of the organic agribusinesses opearting in the US, in the book Cascadian Farm is mentiontioned:</description>

      <description>Last week I commented some things about the first few chapters of The omnivore’s dilemma, this week I finished reading the first part, the one about the industrial food chain, and there are some more things to be said about it.
In chapter 8 the author talks about how the omnivore’s dilemma1 is solved by culture: One eats what one’s parents eat, they eat what their parents ate and so on; through generations cultural eating habits are formed, and those habits are generally sufficient to keep most people healthy.</description>

      <description>I have been reading The omnivore’s dilemma by Michael Pollan lately, the book is a deep dive into how food is produced. It is divided into 4 parts, each one about a way of producing food (Industrial, industrial organical, local sustainable and hunter-gatherer). I am currently at chapter five, still inside the industrial portion of the book and I can tell you it has been unexpected, I had some knowledge about how industrial food is farmed (or more appropiately, manufactured) but there are some things that I find extremely amusing: how, at least in the USA as the book has only talked about it and I don’t know if it applies to any other country, the industrial food system is mostly designed around corn, makig it so cheap that all farmers lose money growing it, yet they can’t grow any other crops because corn is the only thing bought around their farms and only corn is subsidized.</description>

      <description>I avoid almost all covid19 information out there in order to mantain my chill during this time, it is stressful enough to have to go outside to buy groceries surrounded by people that don’t take this situation seriously, I don’t need all my remaining time to be consumed by stress related to unactionable information. Getting that out of the way, this week I read something about why people shouldn’t be doing data visualizations lightly with covid19 data, a must read if you work with data and want to make something pretty to display in your linkedin profile.</description>
