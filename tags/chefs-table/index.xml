      <description>This week I started watching Chef&amp;rsquo;s Table: BBQ, the latest season of Netflix&amp;rsquo;s Chef&amp;rsquo;s Table; one of the episodes is about Rosalia Chay Chuc, a Mayan woman that makes food in the traditional Mayan way.
In the episode Rosalia talks about her children and how she feels about them not embracing the Mayan culture, that made me think about how the idea of modernity lures people into rejecting their culture in favour of the culturally homogenization of big cities.</description>

      <description>Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been watching Chef&amp;rsquo;s Table, as the name sugests it is about chefs, with each episode being a short documentary about a single chef&amp;rsquo;s history, the restaurants in which they are working and why they are cooking as they are. It is hands down one of the best shows I&amp;rsquo;ve seen.
Dan Barber, the chef featured in the second episode, was the one that most resonated with me; the restaurants he owns revolve around the concept of farm to table, cooking the ingredients as close as posible to the source, all local and sustainable.</description>
