      <description>After a few week without any serious reading, I decided to finally finish The Omnivore&amp;rsquo;s Dilemma. Part 4 is about hunting, gathering and gardening food, the least middlemen between you and your food.
Right away I found some points worth discussing, one of the earliest being a remark made that it took ancient hunter-gatherers only about 17 hours a week to hunt and gather enough food for them and their families, compared with the now seemingly universal 40 hour work week it seems that the modern life gives us more things to do and leave us with less time to do them.</description>
