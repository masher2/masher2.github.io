      <description>This month I revisited my favourite anime: GaoGaiGar. No matter how I try to describe how much I like this anime I don&amp;rsquo;t think I can make it justice. On a first glance it is your standard monster of the week mecha anime with a bland plot and over the top fights, but as the show progresses the personalities of the characters begin to shine, they are some of the most likable characters in any anime I have seen.</description>

      <description>On October 7th there was an announcement by the proprietary software giant Adobe to ban al Venezuelan users from using any of its services, not even giving them a refund.1 Such announcement came seemingly out of nowhere, following an executive order that doesn&amp;rsquo;t really impede them from having business relationships with individual venezuelan citizens but with the &amp;ldquo;Goverment of Venezuela&amp;rdquo;.
The implications of such action are absolutely detrimental, as most of the creative workers use or depend on Adobe software.</description>
