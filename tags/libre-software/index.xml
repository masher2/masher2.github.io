      <description>On October 7th there was an announcement by the proprietary software giant Adobe to ban al Venezuelan users from using any of its services, not even giving them a refund.1 Such announcement came seemingly out of nowhere, following an executive order that doesn&amp;rsquo;t really impede them from having business relationships with individual venezuelan citizens but with the &amp;ldquo;Goverment of Venezuela&amp;rdquo;.
The implications of such action are absolutely detrimental, as most of the creative workers use or depend on Adobe software.</description>
