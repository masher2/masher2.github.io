      <description>This week was the definition of dead. Here is the only thing worth sharing that I saw this week and the corresponding music recommendation.
 [podcast] Private Suite Podcast : Vapor Memory Interview: This was an incredible find, I didn&amp;rsquo;t know there was a podcast dedicated to vaporwave until Vapor Memory uploaded this interview on his channel.  Being the go-to channel to discover vaporwave on youtube, Vapor Memory is a very well known name in the vaporwave community, a name I would say as well known as some of the older and well established vaporwave artists.</description>
