      <description>Last week I commented some things about the first few chapters of The omnivore’s dilemma, this week I finished reading the first part, the one about the industrial food chain, and there are some more things to be said about it.
In chapter 8 the author talks about how the omnivore’s dilemma1 is solved by culture: One eats what one’s parents eat, they eat what their parents ate and so on; through generations cultural eating habits are formed, and those habits are generally sufficient to keep most people healthy.</description>
