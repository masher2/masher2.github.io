      <description>This week was the definition of dead. Here is the only thing worth sharing that I saw this week and the corresponding music recommendation.
 [podcast] Private Suite Podcast : Vapor Memory Interview: This was an incredible find, I didn&amp;rsquo;t know there was a podcast dedicated to vaporwave until Vapor Memory uploaded this interview on his channel.  Being the go-to channel to discover vaporwave on youtube, Vapor Memory is a very well known name in the vaporwave community, a name I would say as well known as some of the older and well established vaporwave artists.</description>

      <description>Last week I commented some things about the first few chapters of The omnivore&amp;rsquo;s dilemma, this week I finished reading the first part, the one about the industrial food chain, and there are some more things to be said about it.
In chapter 8 the author talks about how the omnivore&amp;rsquo;s dilemma1 is solved by culture: One eats what one&amp;rsquo;s parents eat, they eat what their parents ate and so on; through generations cultural eating habits are formed, and those habits are generally sufficient to keep most people healthy.</description>
