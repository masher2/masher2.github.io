      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve noted that lately I have developed a view of how life should be lived that can be summarized in 3 points:
 Don&amp;rsquo;t try to optimize your life for anything. Don&amp;rsquo;t mindlessly accept your life as it comes. Don&amp;rsquo;t limit your interests to only one thing.  Most of the comment I have on things I see through the week fit inside those 3 points as I think everybody could benefit from that perspective.</description>
