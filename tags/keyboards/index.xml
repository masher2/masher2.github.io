      <description>This is the first post that I write using my new Drop ALT keyboard, I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect to be this hooked to the typing experience of a mechanical keyboard but how much nicer it feels to type on this can&amp;rsquo;t be ignored, I even placed it on top of my laptop to use it instead of it&amp;rsquo;s own keyboard (inspired by this video).
Another thing that excites me about this keyboard is that it can be customized though QMK, I can see this becoming a new hobby of mine.</description>
