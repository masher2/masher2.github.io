      <description>I have been reading The omnivore’s dillema by Michael Pollan lately, the book is a deep dive into how food is produced. It is divided into 4 parts, each one about a way of producing food (Industrial, industrial organical, local sustainable and hunter-gatherer). I am currently at chapter five, still inside the industrial portion of the book and I can tell you it has been unexpected, I had some knowledge about how industrial food is farmed (or more appropiately, manufactured) but there are some things that I find extremely amusing: how, at least in the USA as the book has only talked about it and I don’t know if it applies to any other country, the industrial food system is mostly designed around corn, makig it so cheap that all farmers lose money growing it, yet they can’t grow any other crops because corn is the only thing bought around their farms and only corn is subsidized.</description>

      <description>The last two weeks have been abysmal, my internet connection went back on mid-week and I haven’t spent much time doing anything other than working. I barely managed to find something worth sharing but here we are, still showing up.
 [video] Negative Oil Prices Explained.: One of the most interesting things I have seen recently. A comprehensive explaination of how derivatives work, the factors that caused oil prices (for a single contract) to become negative recently, what does it mean for the oil industry and why you will never get paid for refueling your car.</description>
