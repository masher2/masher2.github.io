      <description>I’m currently into the local sustainable section of The omnivore’s dilemma, reading about Polyface farm feels like a dream, it’s incredible how that way of farming contrasts with the industrial way of highly scaled monocrop fields.
One of the things that came to my mind whilst reading this section was that automation isn’t always synonym with progress, even though the industrial food system has skyrocketed the production of food, it has done so despite the damage it causes to the land and the ecosystem.</description>
