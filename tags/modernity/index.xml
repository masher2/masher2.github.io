      <description>[video] Zoomer Consooomer gets Red-pilled on Technology: Luke Smith responding to an email asking him about the intersection between technology and life.  In the video, Luke talks about how being aware of the implications of technology in one&amp;rsquo;s life doesn&amp;rsquo;t translate into having to reject everything modernity has to offer, but that being aware of those implications gives you the opportunity to make decisions that limit the negative impact of technology in your life.</description>
