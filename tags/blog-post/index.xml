      <description>[blog-post] Navigating the internet as a non-binary designer This one caught me by surprise, the problems of gender nonconforming people are something that never crosses my mind as I don&amp;rsquo;t know nor interact with any in my daily life. I came across this post on twitter the other day and thought it would be nice to read as I really don&amp;rsquo;t know much about it and it is always nice to see how people can have completely diferent experiences from yours.</description>

      <description>[blog-post] Our history is a battle against the microbes: we lost terribly before science, public health, and vaccines allowed us to protect ourselves A data-backed post showing how much infectious diseases affected us during our history and how vaccines helped us in our struggle for survival.
This post comes in a time most opportune, as more and more people are concerned with the effects and motivations behind vaccination, serving as a reminder that without vaccines the world would be an even dangerous place than it is right now.</description>
