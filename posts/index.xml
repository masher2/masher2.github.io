<p>On October 7th there was an announcement by the proprietary software giant Adobe to ban al Venezuelan users from using any of its services, not even giving them a refund.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Such announcement came seemingly out of nowhere, following an executive order that doesn’t really impede them from having business relationships with individual venezuelan citizens but with the “Goverment of Venezuela”.</p>
<p>The implications of such action are absolutely detrimental, as most of the creative workers use or depend on Adobe software. That is to be expected though, as Adobe software is practically an industry standard and using anything that isn’t from Adobe for that kind of work is not as common as it should be.</p>
<p>So, what should a person trying to earn a decent income in the creative world should resort to after getting prema-banned from using the most common, known, and arguably powerful tools in that area? I know what crosses the mind of any individual in that place: Piracy. But that should not be the way.</p>
<p>Legal and moral affairs apart, piracy should never be an option, it doesn’t solve the fundamental flaw that drove the person to it in the first place: the lack of ownership of your software.</p>
<p>Propietary software is owned only by the company that develops it (the proprietor), the copy that resides in your machine or in the browser through yout account is just a leased version of the software, your rights are limited in a way that gives the proprietor absolute power over it and leaves you completely vulnerable to events like this one. Piracy doesn’t magically makes you own the software, it only makes your leased copy work (maybe partially) and nothing more, maybe an update will make your copy stop working again.</p>
<p>The best alternative is libre software, software that respects your freedom to use it as you wish, without discriminating against your nationality or your purchasing power. However, libre software is often overlooked by professionals and inexperienced alike for being free of cost, gratis; as if for being free it means it is subpar software.</p>
<p>There is a certain degree of truth that proprietary software is more polished and more featureful, as any project should be if it has the resources of Adobe to maintain it; nevertheless libre alternatives to Adobe software are very well developed and most would be powerful enough for most creatives out there.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doBR1Ae78aw">Here</a> is a good list of libre alternatives to the Adobe Creative Suite, the video is targeted to linux users but as with most libre software it is available in both Windows and MacOS also.</p>
<p>The point of libre software is not that it is free of cost, the point is that it respects your freedom to use it as you wish, doesn’t push the interests of the creators of the software over the interests of its users and will always be transparent in its inner workings.</p>
<p>I want to end this with a quote by Linus from LinusTechTips that resumes everything that is wrong with the current state of software:</p>
<p>“So, this sucks for venezuelans but it also kind of has the potential to suck for everyone because this is a reminder of the predicament that we’ve gotten ourselves into by creating a world that is dependant on subscription services.” - Linus <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLUALcR2UP4">techlinked</a></p>

            <title>Crypto, banking, and spending money in Venezuela</title>

            <description type="html"><![CDATA[


<p>Today I saw <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDjww6VAKM8">Universal Access to Basic Finance</a> by Andreas M. Antonopoulos, he starts the talk saying that when visiting Argentina in 2013 for the first time he didn’t need to explain “why, why bitcoin, why open blockchains, why freedom of finance”, that is because all the people in the conference room were interested in the “how”, because they already understanded the “why”; those opening words struck me, because here in Venezuela, at least in the kind of environment I am and the kind of people I know, most of us already know the “why”: The Bolivar Soberano (VES).</p>
<p>After two moneraty reconversions, the first in 2008 removing three zeros, the second last year (2018) removing five more, the VES is nothing more than a bad joke to all of us that remain in the country<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. This has led people to use the US Dollar (USD) as a preferred currency as its value stays stable in time compared to the VES.</p>
<p>The problem then arises, food is mostly traded in VES, while goods like smartphones, shoes, and home appliances are preferably traded in USD because holding such an amount of VES would be too risky<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> or even plain impossible for an individual to obtain (at the time of writing 1 USD ≈ 14000 VES). Add to the problem the insecurity and carrying 500 USD in one’s pocket while using public transportation is not something anybody would want to do. Living through this it’s only natural to gravitate towards cryptocurrency, even with its volatility, Bitcoin (BTC) is a safer place to hold your money than in VES in a bank account.</p>
<p>Returning to the talk, mr Antonopoulos explains how the banking system keeps the unbanked poor, making their life unnecessarily difficult by denying them basic financial services and sentencing them to cash only and higher fees for things like sending money to someone. For someone like me, who has never left Venezuela and thus has never had the opportunity to open an account in any other currency that is not the Bolivar, spending money in an economy where you either need a suspiciously huge<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> amount of VES in your account or need a dangerous amount of USD in your pocket is particularly challenging. That is not the only way though, as many stores (WAY more than those who accept crypto) accept not only VES or cash USD but <a href="https://www.zellepay.com/">Zelle</a>, a payment system between USA bank accounts; I, who am paid mostly in crypto<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>, find very difficult spending my money in my home country.</p>
<p>Earlier this week I was in a “technology mall” in Caracas trying to buy a smartphone for my uncle, I asked in almost every store in that shopping mall asking if they accepted any form of cryptocurrency, something like an hour and more or less 30 stores later I found only one little store that accepted crypto; only one store, in a shopping mall dedicated almost to tech stores, accepted the (arguably) easiest and safest way for a venezuelan who has never left the country to use his money.</p>
<p>Another interesting idea that mr Antonopoulos spoke about was the “false idea of safety through totalitarian control”, the idea that through massive surveillance of the population all crime will be thwarted, but just as George Orwell depicts in 1984, surveillance only hurts the good people being surveilled, there will always be people powerful enough to avoid surveillance, or at least its consecuences, we as venezuelans know first hand that fact<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Nevertheless not everything is bad, as more people talk about crypto more stores will realize there is an oportunity there and will dive into it. I’ll keep asking in every store I enter if they accept crypto, and will keep spreading the word of libre software, because if people don’t know there is an alternative to the systems they are accustomed to they can’t make different choices with how they live their lives.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>A recurring joke between my friends is that we will become millionaires before the year ends, as we find ourselves holding more hundreds of thousands of VES just for weekly expenses.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>This price tag made me laugh, it’s amazing seeing the price also in Bolivares Fuertes (VEF) as it quickly became too confusing to compare to after the VES reconversion. Realizing that a ~50 USD faucet is worth 67 billions VEF or 67 trillion plain Bolivares (before the first reconversion) is bewildering. <img src="/posts/crypto-banking-and-spending-money-in-venezuela/faucet.jpeg" alt="675 thousand VES faucet" height="400"/><a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
