            <div class="post-content">
                <p>I have been reading <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Omnivore%27s_Dilemma" target="_blank"><em>The omnivore&rsquo;s dilemma</em> by Michael Pollan</a> lately, the book is a deep dive into how food is produced.
It is divided into 4 parts, each one about a way of producing food (Industrial, industrial organical, local sustainable and hunter-gatherer).
I am currently at chapter five, still inside the industrial portion of the book and I can tell you it has been unexpected, I had some knowledge about how industrial food is farmed (or more appropiately, manufactured) but there are some things that I find extremely amusing: how, at least in the USA as the book has only talked about it and I don&rsquo;t know if it applies to any other country, the industrial food system is mostly designed around corn, makig it so cheap that all farmers lose money growing it, yet they can&rsquo;t grow any other crops because corn is the only thing bought around their farms and only corn is subsidized.</p>

<p>Another point that is made through the first four chapters is that the industrial food system doesn&rsquo;t necessarily result in cheaper food for the people, only in cheap food made <em>from</em> corn or soy, i.e. soft drinks and snacks.</p>

<p>Here is an exceprt from the book that summarizes one of the main problems of the industrial food system:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A food chain in nature helps us understand who eats what (or whom). But the food chain that feeds most Americans is anything but natural. The industrial food chain that supplies our supermarkets stretches thousands of miles and has dozens of different links. It’s a chain that’s powered by oil and gasoline and controlled by giant corporations. It’s a chain that separates us from our food and keeps us from knowing what it really is we’re eating.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P27HRClMf2U" target="_blank">[video] What face masks actually do against coronavirus</a>: Where I live face masks are enforced when going out, but the great majority of people in the street have DIY masks, that was a stress factor for me when going out to do grocery shopping because I thought that wearing those masks is like wearing nothing as common fabrics don&rsquo;t serve as a barrier for the majority of particles that are expelled from our mouths as we cough, sneeze or even talk.</li>
</ul>

<p>This video besides explaining that it is true that DIY face masks don&rsquo;t protect nearly as much as surgical masks, they are good enough if used in conjuction with social distancing and hand washing.
  Sometimes one just needs someone well versed in the field to ease one&rsquo;s preoccupations.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWssRVJgPqc" target="_blank">[video] The hippest internet cafe of 1995</a>: A short video about one of the first internet cafes back in 1995.
It is interesting to see how the world has change in over 25 years, from a time where few people know what even the @ symbol was to now, where if you don&rsquo;t have email nor a smartphone you can be denied a lot of oportunities.</p></li>

<li><p>[music] <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAMt0YJ0MyA" target="_blank">[youtube]</a> <a href="https://underwater-computing.bandcamp.com/album/qv-rivs" target="_blank">[bandcamp]</a> Underwater Computing : ΔQVΔRIVS

</ul>

<p>Another underwater vaporwave journey, a compilation of songs from <a href="https://underwater-computing.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">Underwater Computing</a> vaporwave label.
  Just under one and a half hours of incredibly smooth sounds and watery aesthetics this is one good compilation</p>

<p>The 7th song <a href="https://underwater-computing.bandcamp.com/track/--72" target="_blank">バーチャルボーイＡ ｔ ｓ ｕ - 海の波のように</a> is out of this world, I think it samples a song from Yu-gi-oh! Forbidden memories but I could be wrong here. Really good stuff that you should check out if you are in for an adventure.</p>
