<p>The last two weeks have been abysmal, my internet connection went back on mid-week and I haven’t spent much time doing anything other than working. I barely managed to find something worth sharing but here we are, still showing up.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGDQzORZ4NM">[video] Negative Oil Prices Explained.</a>: One of the most interesting things I have seen recently. A comprehensive explaination of how derivatives work, the factors that caused oil prices (for a single contract) to become negative recently, what does it mean for the oil industry and why you will never get paid for refueling your car.</p>
<p>This video answered all the questions I had about that event, it was so strange seing all the headlines and commentaries about the oil prices going down like crazy and not understanding why something like that can happen or how could that affect us. After watching this I retrospectively see all the memes about negative oil prices and can understand the misconceptions in which those are founded. There is a lot to gain from this video, absolutely recommended.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ECqDaPjjV0">[video] The Stock Market vs. The Economy</a>: A data backed explaination of the differences between how the economy and the stock market behave in conjunction. It serves to answer the question “If the economy seems to be colapsing, why does the stock markets keep growing or is not as affected as I think it should be?”.</p>
<p>It can be a little technical at times but it’s accessible if you are not afraid of looking up terms you don’t understand.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OURKqOIAbck">[video] Can Anyone Learn to Code?</a>: This is more on the motivational side of things rather than educative. Even if the video is about code, “code” can be replaced with any other discipline or skill without it losing relevance. Proficiency is all about practice, even if someone can become profficient in something more easily than you are you don’t have to be discouraged by it, because with enough time and effort invested any skill or discipline can be learned.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnjaGH8PR4Q">[music] Irresistible (Vaporwave mix)</a>: If you could distil classic vaporwave to it’s essence this is what it would sound like.</p>
<p>A carefuly made mix by the one and only <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Kurdtbada/">Kurdtbada</a>, one of my favourite youtube channels, dedicated mostly to upload vaporwave mixes, all of Kurdtbada’s uploads are excelent, but this one in particular has a feeling that reminded me of when I first started listening to vaporwave. A retro aesthetic transmitted solely through sound, an adventure on it’s own. Close your eyes, let yourself go and experience vaporwave at its finest.</p></li>
