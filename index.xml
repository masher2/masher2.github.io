      <description>Recently I’ve been watching Chef’s Table, as the name sugests it is about chefs, with each episode being a short documentary about a single chef’s history, the restaurants in which they are working and why they are cooking as they are. It is hands down one of the best shows I’ve seen.
Dan Barber, the chef featured in the second episode, was the one that most resonated with me; the restaurants he owns revolve around the concept of farm to table, cooking the ingredients as close as posible to the source, all local and sustainable.</description>

      <description>I’m currently into the local sustainable section of The omnivore’s dilemma, reading about Polyface farm feels like a dream, it’s incredible how that way of farming contrasts with the industrial way of highly scaled monocrop fields.
One of the things that came to my mind whilst reading this section was that automation isn’t always synonym with progress, even though the industrial food system has skyrocketed the production of food, it has done so despite the damage it causes to the land and the ecosystem.</description>

      <description>This week I finished the second part of The omnivore’s dilemma, the one about the industrial organic food system. Not much changes compared to the plain industrial food system, the main difference stands in the lack of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, but the conditions of everything else, from how fields are distributed and harvested to how animals are kept stays the same, factory farms.
The funny thing about this is the history behind some of the organic agribusinesses opearting in the US, in the book Cascadian Farm is mentiontioned:</description>

      <description>Last week I commented some things about the first few chapters of The omnivore’s dilemma, this week I finished reading the first part, the one about the industrial food chain, and there are some more things to be said about it.
In chapter 8 the author talks about how the omnivore’s dilemma1 is solved by culture: One eats what one’s parents eat, they eat what their parents ate and so on; through generations cultural eating habits are formed, and those habits are generally sufficient to keep most people healthy.</description>

      <description>I have been reading The omnivore’s dilemma by Michael Pollan lately, the book is a deep dive into how food is produced. It is divided into 4 parts, each one about a way of producing food (Industrial, industrial organical, local sustainable and hunter-gatherer). I am currently at chapter five, still inside the industrial portion of the book and I can tell you it has been unexpected, I had some knowledge about how industrial food is farmed (or more appropiately, manufactured) but there are some things that I find extremely amusing: how, at least in the USA as the book has only talked about it and I don’t know if it applies to any other country, the industrial food system is mostly designed around corn, makig it so cheap that all farmers lose money growing it, yet they can’t grow any other crops because corn is the only thing bought around their farms and only corn is subsidized.</description>

      <description>The last two weeks have been abysmal, my internet connection went back on mid-week and I haven’t spent much time doing anything other than working. I barely managed to find something worth sharing but here we are, still showing up.

A comprehensive explaination of how derivatives work, the factors that caused oil prices (for a single contract) to become negative recently, what does it mean for the oil industry and why you will never get paid for refueling your car.</description>

      <description>Another slow week with nonexistent home internet, using my phone hotspot to at least get some work done. Magically I managed to find content to share here.
Also I found a topic I want to delve deeper into but I need real internet to flesh it out, stay tuned in the next few weeks.

      <description>I avoid almost all covid19 information out there in order to mantain my chill during this time, it is stressful enough to have to go outside to buy groceries surrounded by people that don’t take this situation seriously, I don’t need all my remaining time to be consumed by stress related to unactionable information. Getting that out of the way, this week I read something about why people shouldn’t be doing data visualizations lightly with covid19 data, a must read if you work with data and want to make something pretty to display in your linkedin profile.</description>

      <description>This was a slow week, between my internet being at the absolute worst speed possible and almost all my free time spent playing Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth (DSCS) on my Nintendo Switch I didn’t manage to find much, nontheless here are a few interesting things that I thought worth sharing.

      <description>I had been planning to blog more but I haven’t had the motivation to do so, so instead of focusing all my mental energy into a single topic that I just didn’t have so much to talk about or doing a project that really wasn’t as fun as I thought it could be I will be sharing here a few interesting things (and my comments on some of those things) that I have seen on a weekly basis (hopefully).</description>

      <description>Inspired by this datacamp post and the current events happening in Chile I decided to give it a try to make my own version of a tweet streaming script, with the intention of using it when another event of that magnitud happens and maybe getting some useful insights then, or maybe not, at least I had fun while doing this.
Setting up the structure of the script The first thing I did was plan how to structure the script.</description>

      <description>On October 7th there was an announcement by the proprietary software giant Adobe to ban al Venezuelan users from using any of its services, not even giving them a refund.1 Such announcement came seemingly out of nowhere, following an executive order that doesn’t really impede them from having business relationships with individual venezuelan citizens but with the “Goverment of Venezuela”.
The implications of such action are absolutely detrimental, as most of the creative workers use or depend on Adobe software.</description>

      <description>Today I saw Universal Access to Basic Finance by Andreas M. Antonopoulos, he starts the talk saying that when visiting Argentina in 2013 for the first time he didn’t need to explain “why, why bitcoin, why open blockchains, why freedom of finance”, that is because all the people in the conference room were interested in the “how”, because they already understanded the “why”; those opening words struck me, because here in Venezuela, at least in the kind of environment I am and the kind of people I know, most of us already know the “why”: The Bolivar Soberano (VES).</description>
