      <description>I am Jesús Pérez, a statistician graduated from the UCV (Universidad Central de Venezuela) in 2018. I&amp;rsquo;m interested in data science, cryptocurrencies, libre software and ｖａｐｏｒｗａｖｅ.
I&amp;rsquo;m not an expert in any field so I&amp;rsquo;ll be posting about whatever new I learn that would be nice to share and interesting things I find in the internet.
@ or DM me on twitter if you want @masher_2, I&amp;rsquo;m not active but maybe I will.</description>
