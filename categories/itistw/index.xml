      <description>I avoid almost all covid19 information out there in order to mantain my chill during this time, it is stressful enough to have to go outside to buy groceries surrounded by people that don’t take this situation seriously, I don’t need all my remaining time to be consumed by stress related to unactionable information. Getting that out of the way, this week I read something about why people shouldn’t be doing data visualizations lightly with covid19 data, a must read if you work with data and want to make something pretty to display in your linkedin profile.</description>

      <description>This was a slow week, between my internet being at the absolute worst speed possible and almost all my free time spent playing Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth (DSCS) on my Nintendo Switch I didn’t manage to find much, nontheless here are a few interesting things that I thought worth sharing.

      <description>I had been planning to blog more but I haven’t had the motivation to do so, so instead of focusing all my mental energy into a single topic that I just didn’t have so much to talk about or doing a project that really wasn’t as fun as I thought it could be I will be sharing here a few interesting things (and my comments on some of those things) that I have seen on a weekly basis (hopefully).</description>
